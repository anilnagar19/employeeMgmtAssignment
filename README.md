 # Employee Management 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0 and used Signals to store form data. 

## Notes
1. I've implemented distinct user interfaces for the employee list screen on both mobile and desktop/tablet platforms.
2. On mobile devices, employee data will be displayed using a card-based UI, while on tablets and desktops, the data will be presented in a table format.
3. The "To Monday," "To Tuesday," and "After 1 Week" buttons utilize the current date as a reference point for calculating the subsequent dates.
